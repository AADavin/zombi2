"""Traits — a value riding the species tree (level 4).

A trait is not a genealogy of events like the other three levels; it is a **value that rides the
tree** — a body size, a habitat, a presence/absence — and you observe the value itself, not an event
count (``docs/design/trait-api.md``). So the trait level has no "rate of events": its compact
**source of truth is the value at every node** (``node_values``), not an event log, and the rich
views — ``values`` at the extant tips, the discrete stochastic ``history``, the realized ``events`` —
are derived from it. That is a real seam, named rather than papered over. What keeps traits inside the
one framework is that the *ways* a value evolves reuse the same ``scope(base) × modifiers`` rate
grammar (SPEC §5).

This is the **continuous** trait level — ``simulate_continuous`` — and its three variants are the
same diffusion wearing different knobs, not three classes (SPEC §4):

- **Brownian motion**, the native process: over a branch the value moves by ``Normal(0, σ²·dt)``, so
  node-by-node in preorder it reproduces the exact tip law (Felsenstein 1985): the extant tips are
  multivariate-normal with variance ``σ² ×`` (root-to-tip depth) and covariance ``σ² ×`` (shared
  path length). ``rate`` is the variance-rate σ².
- **Ornstein–Uhlenbeck**: add ``reverts_to`` (the optimum θ) and ``pull`` (the strength α) and the
  diffusion is pulled toward θ — stabilizing selection. The exact per-branch transition is normal
  with mean ``θ + (x−θ)·e^{−α·dt}`` and variance ``σ²/(2α)·(1−e^{−2α·dt})``. (These are the same two
  knobs the CIR clock grows one level over — a shared vocabulary, not shared code.)
- **Early burst / ACDC**: give ``rate`` a ``OnTime`` skyline (``rate = σ² * mod.OnTime({0: 1, 5: 0.2})``)
  and σ² changes through time — the *same* ``OnTime`` modifier that gives the species tree its skyline.
  The per-branch variance is then the exact integral ``∫ σ²(t) dt`` over the branch.
- **Variable-rates BM** ("ClaDS for traits"): give ``rate`` an ``FromParent`` modifier
  (``rate = σ² * mod.FromParent(spread=0.3)``) and σ² drifts branch-to-branch — each lineage inherits
  its parent's σ² times a lognormal kick at the split — the *same* ``FromParent`` modifier that drifts
  the species rate (ClaDS) and the autocorrelated clock, one level over. (``reverts_to`` / ``pull`` are
  OU function arguments that revert the trait *value*, **not** a modifier — a rate modifier reverts a
  *rate*, which is the sequences level's CIR clock, a different mechanism.)
- **Diversity-dependent** (ecological limits): give ``rate`` a ``OnTotalDiversity`` modifier
  (``rate = σ² * mod.OnTotalDiversity(cap=100)``) and σ² slows as the clade fills — scaled by
  ``(1 − standing_diversity/cap)`` as the tree's lineages-through-time grows — the *same* ``OnTotalDiversity``
  modifier that slows species diversification, read here off the fixed tree (one-way, tree → trait).

``rate`` thus takes the whole modifier vocabulary — ``OnTime``, ``FromParent``, ``OnTotalDiversity`` — like any
other rate, and they compose (``σ² * OnTime({…}) * FromParent(spread=…)``).

``rate`` is *per lineage*: each lineage carries its own independent diffusion, never pooled across the
tree. That non-pooling is the trait seam in the rate grammar — the engine evaluates the rate one
lineage at a time (``lineages=1``), where the event levels sum a per-unit rate over everything alive
at once. (OU with a time-varying σ² — the two knob-sets at once — is deferred; use one or the other.)

The **discrete** twin is ``simulate_discrete`` — a state switching along the tree (the Mk model). Its
jumps are simulated *exactly* by the Gillespie algorithm along every branch, so each node's
``(state, duration)`` segments *are* the realized history (a stochastic character map, ``.history``)
and ``.events`` reads off the transitions — the trait level's first genuine event log. ``switch``
gives the rates (symmetric shortcut, ``{"a->b": rate}`` dict, or a ``k×k`` matrix).

Still to come, each its own slice: the ``correlation=`` overlay for traits that drift together, and
the threshold model (a discrete state read off a continuous liability) that underpins its discrete
case; then the named-and-deferred cases (``at_speciation`` jumps, ``regimes``, hidden states, DEC →
experimental). SSE (BiSSE/MuSSE/QuaSSE) is **not** a trait model — it is trait↔species *joint*, Part III.

    stochastic character map — and ``.events`` reads off the transitions.

    ``tree`` is the **complete** species tree (a :class:`~zombi2.species.Tree` or a
    :class:`~zombi2.species.SpeciesResult`); the trait evolves on every lineage, and ``.values`` reads
    the extant tips. ``states`` is the list of state labels (≥ 2, unique). ``switch`` gives the
    transition rates — a symmetric rate (``switch=0.1``), a ``{"marine->terrestrial": 0.1}`` dict of
    asymmetric rates, or a ``k×k`` matrix; see :func:`_q_matrix`. ``start`` is the root state (a label
    in ``states``); ``None`` draws one uniformly at random. As under convention B for continuous
    traits, the root evolves over its own branch, so ``node_values[root]`` is the state at the first
    split. Deterministic given ``seed``.

    ``liability`` / ``threshold`` (a discrete state read off an underlying continuous liability — the
